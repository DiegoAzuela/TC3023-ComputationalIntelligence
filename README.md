Coursework Submitted Feb-Jun 2020

Students will understand the different techniques for solving problems of combinatorial optimization with heuristics, such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing; as well as techniques for representing and handling uncertain or imprecise knowledge, such as Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic. The student will also be able to identify and model problems, and implement solutions using these techniques. School: Tecnologico de Monterrey.
